I hold a PhD in computational chemistry (Quantum Chemical Topology group, University of Manchester, UK), focused on machine learning potentials and next-generation force field development. My research involved building machine learning potentials which are used in molecular simulations, as well as data pipelines for processing the large amount of information required for the models. I have strong programming skills, particularly in Python, have developed several tools relating to computational chemistry data management and machine learning force fields. I have also contributed to several related open-source projects related to computational chemistry and machine learning. Previously, I graduated with an MChem degree (First-Class) from the University of Manchester.

I have a deep interest in the intersection of chemistry, physics, and computer science. Particularly, I am interested in quantum chemistry algorithms, machine learning, and applications of molecular simulations drug discovery and development, protein structure prediction, and materials science.
